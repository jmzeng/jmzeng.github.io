	abstract = {PURPOSE
              Knowing the treatments administered to patients with cancer is important for treatment planning and correlating treatment patterns with outcomes for personalized medicine study. However, existing methods to identify treatments are often lacking. We develop a natural language processing approach with structured electronic medical records and unstructured clinical notes to identify the initial treatment administered to patients with cancer.
            
            
              METHODS
              We used a total number of 4,412 patients with 483,782 clinical notes from the Stanford Cancer Institute Research Database containing patients with nonmetastatic prostate, oropharynx, and esophagus cancer. We trained treatment identification models for each cancer type separately and compared performance of using only structured, only unstructured ( bag-of-words, doc2vec, fasttext), and combinations of both ( structured + bow, structured + doc2vec, structured + fasttext). We optimized the identification model among five machine learning methods (logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, random forest, support vector machines, and stochastic gradient boosting). The treatment information recorded in the cancer registry is the gold standard and compares our methods to an identification baseline with billing codes.
            
            
              RESULTS
              For prostate cancer, we achieved an f1-score of 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.97 to 1.00) for radiation and 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.99 to 1.00) for surgery using structured + doc2vec. For oropharynx cancer, we achieved an f1-score of 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.93) for chemoradiation and 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.69 to 0.95) for surgery using doc2vec. For esophagus cancer, we achieved an f1-score of 1.0 (95\% CI, 1.0 to 1.0) for both chemoradiation and surgery using all combinations of structured and unstructured data. We found that employing the free-text clinical notes outperforms using the billing codes or only structured data for all three cancer types.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our results show that treatment identification using free-text clinical notes greatly improves upon the performance using billing codes and simple structured data. The approach can be used for treatment cohort identification and adapted for longitudinal cancer treatment identification.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges of deep learning tools is their inability to capture model uncertainty. While Bayesian deep learning can be used to tackle the problem, Bayesian neural networks often require more time and computational power to train than deterministic networks. Our work explores whether fully Bayesian networks are needed to successfully capture model uncertainty. We vary the number and position of Bayesian layers in a network and compare their performance on active learning with the MNIST dataset. We found that we can fully capture the model uncertainty by using only a few Bayesian layers near the output of the network, combining the advantages of deterministic and Bayesian networks.},

	abstract = {We developed a probabilistic model to support the classification decisions made by radiologists in mammography practice. Using the feature observations and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classifications from radiologists examining diagnostic and screening mammograms, we modeled their decisions to understand their judgments. Our model could help improve the decisions made by radiologists using their own feature observations and classifications while maintaining their observed sensitivities. Based on 112,433 mammographic cases from 36,111 patients and 13 radiologists at 2 separate institutions with a 1.1\% prevalence of malignancy, we trained a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN) to estimate the malignancy probabilities of lesions. For each radiologist, we learned an observed probabilistic threshold within the model. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of each radiologist against the BN model using either their observed threshold or the standard 2\% threshold recommended by BI-RADS. We found significant variability among the radiologists’ observed thresholds. By applying the observed thresholds, the BN model showed a 0.01\% (1 case) increase in false negatives and a 28.9\% (3612 cases) reduction in false positives. When using the standard 2\% BI-RADS-recommended threshold, there was a 26.7\% (47 cases) increase in false negatives and a 47.3\% (5911 cases) reduction in false positives. Our results show that we can significantly reduce screening mammography false positives with a minimal increase in false negatives. We find that learning radiologists’ observed thresholds provides valuable information regarding the conservativeness of clinical practice and allows us to quantify the variability in sensitivity across and within institutions. Our model could provide support to radiologists to improve their performance and consistency within mammography practice.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates synthetically generated healthcare data for biases and investigates the effect of fairness mitigation techniques on utility-fairness. Privacy laws limit access to health data such as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to preserve patient privacy. Albeit essential, these laws hinder research reproducibility. Synthetic data is a viable solution that can enable access to data similar to real healthcare data without privacy risks. Healthcare datasets may have biases in which certain protected groups might experience worse outcomes than others. With the real data having biases, the fairness of synthetically generated health data comes into question. In this paper, we evaluate the fairness of models generated on two healthcare datasets for gender and race biases. We generate synthetic versions of the dataset using a Generative Adversarial Network called HealthGAN, and compare the real and synthetic model's balanced accuracy and fairness scores. We find that synthetic data has different fairness properties compared to real data and fairness mitigation techniques perform differently, highlighting that synthetic data is not bias free.},
